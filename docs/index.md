# Kubernetes intro setup

!!! warning
    I wanted to figure out how hard it would be to get a kubernetes cluster up and running om a bare metal machine.
    This setup is by **no means secure** and should **never** be used to a production environment. This is only an experiment!

## Content

* Install an [ESXi](./esxi.md) on a baremetal machine
* Create a [kubernetes cluster](./kubernetes.md)
* Connecting to the cluster, using [kubectl](./kubectl.md)
* Add a cluster [dashboard](./dashboard.md)
* Install [helm](./helm.md)
* Install [rancher](./rancher.md)
* Install an application on the cluster.
