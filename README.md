# Baremetal Kubernetes experiment

> **warning**: I wanted to figure out how hard it would be to get a kubernetes cluster up and running om a bare metal machine.
    This setup is by **no means secure** and should **never** be used to a production environment. This is only an experiment!

See the result at [Github pages](https://bravecobra.github.io/docker-kubernetes/)
